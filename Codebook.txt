Codebook for dfGalaxySAverages.txt database using run_Analysis.R

The final tiny dataset generated from running run_Analysis.R is dfGalaxySAverages.  The variables are the averages of either the mean or standard deviation of measurements of a subject's activities while wearing a Galaxy S II smartphone on their waist.  Any column that is not a mean or a standard deviation of a measurement has been dropped.  The measurements are taken from the smartphone's sensors.  A list of the measurements can be found in 'features.txt'.  The technical descriptions of the measurements can be found at 'features_info.txt'.

The column names for dfGalaxySAverages remain true to the original data variable names except for the addition of the words "Average of ..." in recognition that the data have been manipulated to reflect the average of a number of observations for the same unique activity by the same person (subject).

The Subject IDs have been preserved (there were 30 subjects and each was assigned a factor ID between 1 to 30).  The activity labels have been replaced by their corresponding descriptive activity names (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) as specified in 'activity_labels.txt' (from the .zip file linked above).
